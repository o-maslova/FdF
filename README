This project is about creating a simplified graphic “wireframe” (“fils de fer” in french, hence the name of the project) representation of a relief landscape linking various points (x, y, z) via segments. The coordinates of this landscape are stored in a file passed as a parameter to your program. Here is an example:

0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0

Each number corresponds to a point in space:
• The horizontal position corresponds to its axis.
• The vertical position corresponds to its ordinate.
• The value corresponds to its altitude.

Some needed functions for this project was taken from libft project and they are placed in libft directory.
Maps for testing the project are placed in maps directory.
 

To compile the project you need to do in your fdf directory:

make
